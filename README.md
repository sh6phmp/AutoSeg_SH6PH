# AutoSeg_SH6PH
Autosegmentation code modified for brachytherapy based on [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNe##t)
## Usage
1. Use the converters optimized for bracahytherapy (Task501~503) located in /dataset_conversion to generate .nii files from raw dicom files.
2. The .nii files will be generated by following the nnU-Net requirements and seperated into train and validation dataset randomly. 
3. Use nnUNet_train command to train all the folds of the 2D/3D/Cascade model.
4. Use ensemble command to find the best model configuration.(optional)
5. Use nnUNet_predict to generate predicted masks based on the input test cases.
6. Use postprocessing command to remove bubbles.(optional)
7. Evaluate the model performance by excuting the commands in /evaluation/evaluator, 
## Running Environments
The training code of the model is modified to be compatible both with Windows and Ubuntu. However, the model can only be predicted on Ubuntu, we are working on some compatibility issues to make prediction on Windows system possible.
